/**
 * <h3>Functional try to execute blocks</h3>
 * Using functional blocks to handle operations, that are intended to operate
 * properly, simplify the code and makes it more readable. It's also good way to
 * deal with untested, uncovered {@code catch} blocks. It's easy and gives
 * developers nice way of dealing with countless operations that suppose to work
 * as intended.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * InputStream is = EidExecutions.tryToExecute(new UnsafeSupplier&lt;InputStream&gt;() {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     public InputStream get() throws IOException {
 *         return this.getClass().getClassLoader()
 *             .getResourceAsStream("project.properties");
 *     }
 * }, "20150718:121521");
